  "scope": "The network metadata model (NMM) is based on the ILTER and LTER Europe requirements. It is meant to collect basic information on the network itself as well as the associated information provided within DEIMS-SDR. This includes the links to associated persons as well as research sites and datasets. For Networks managed as specific entries within DEIMS-SDR the affiliation of Research sites can be managed and the status of affiliation can be changed. The content type Network applies therefore to ILTER/LTER networks especially.",

Monitoring and research is focussing on air pollution effects on forested catchments and its interaction with climate change. The Zöbelboden represents one of the best known karst catchments in Europe with long-term data series of the major components of its ecosystems. The Zöbelboden is managed by the Umweltbundesamt GmbH. Sampling of chemical specimen is done by local staff. Chemical analyses are carried out by the laboratory of the Umweltbundesamt in Vienna. All data and metadata from monitoring and research projects are stored in a semantically structured database.",
