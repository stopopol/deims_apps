  "scope": "The person metadata model (PMM) serves several purposes. First, it provides a source for dataset metadata creators, contact points, and metadata providers (basic contact information). The required information is a surname and email address. The person MD model apply for physical persons, e.g. researcher, as well as for administrative persons, e.g. funding organisation. In this context, organisations are considered to be persons. For an “organizational” person, the organization name is entered in the surname field.",

Use (Y) for a subsite. Please make sure that the number is not used for any site in your country. For example: LTER_EU_AT_001. For other networks than LTER a different prefix for the network identification is used. If you are part of the Critical Zones or Soiltrek Network, then the format for your code is: CZO_EU_XX_YY(Y); where XX is the 2-letter country code and YY(Y) represents a number.
