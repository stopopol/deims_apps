  "scope": "The dataset metadata model (DSMM) is based on requirements defined by the target stakeholder groups. The user requirements for the content were harmonized with the INSPIRE metadata regulation and implemented using Ecological Metadata Language (EML) metadata specification, version 2.1.1. EnvEurope focused on the EML metadata standard (stemming from the US LTER activities) but also provides an interface to discover ISO compliant metadata based on XSLT transformation EML2ISO developed in the project and Geonetwork opensource CSW implementation.",

    "Title": {
      "field_name": "title",
      "Definition": "Provides a name of the dataset that is being documented as is known within the community described in detail by following elements. Title is a characteristic, and often unique and is the most informative element of a metadata record and usually with the highest priority as search engines go to this element.",
      "Recommendation & Hints": "Title has to be concise and precisely describing the point. It should not contain unexplained acronyms or abbreviations. It is recommended a maximum length of 200 characters and keeping the similarity with the original title of the dataset in the sense of the ‘official naming’ established in the community. If the dataset is part of a larger project, it is recommended to indicate the Project at the end of the title, in brackets. In case of Project names, abbreviations are allowed, as long as the rest of the title follows the guidelines above and the abbreviation is spelled out immediately in the abstract",

We provide a long-term dataset (1951-2010) collected at two stations near the town of Bosco di Corniglio. In particular, from 1951 to 1998 precipitation data were collected at the weather station of Bosco Centrale. Between 1999 and july 2000 the station was out of order (no data available) and from 2001 the Bosco Centrale weather station was substituted by the Bosco di Corniglio station. The two weather stations are less than 1 km apart and they are about 6 km far from Lake Santo Parmense and 7 km far from Lake Scuro Parmense. We also provide a shorter dataset of precipitation data collected from 1994 to 2010 at the weather station of Lagdei. This station is closer to our sampling sites (about 1 km from Lake Santo Parmense and 5 km from Lake Scuro Parmense), but a shorter time series is available. All weather stations are managed by the the Environmental Protection Agency of the Emilia-Romagna region (ARPA Emilia-Romagna), which ...",
