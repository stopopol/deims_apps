Use (Y) for a subsite. Please make sure that the number is not used for any site in your country. For example: LTER_EU_AT_001. For other networks than LTER a different prefix for the network identification is used. If you are part of the Critical Zones or Soiltrek Network, then the format for your code is: CZO_EU_XX_YY(Y); where XX is the 2-letter country code and YY(Y) represents a number.

Monitoring and research is focussing on air pollution effects on forested catchments and its interaction with climate change. The Zöbelboden represents one of the best known karst catchments in Europe with long-term data series of the major components of its ecosystems. The Zöbelboden is managed by the Umweltbundesamt GmbH. Sampling of chemical specimen is done by local staff. Chemical analyses are carried out by the laboratory of the Umweltbundesamt in Vienna. All data and metadata from monitoring and research projects are stored in a semantically structured database.",

Today, LTER Zöbelboden represents one of the best known karst catchments in Europe with long-term data series of the major components of its ecosystems. Researchers from across Austria and Europe use the site for their studies when long-term data, expensive infrastructure or complex research logistics are on demand. Objectives of the project LTER Zöbelboden is a small, well definable catchment of 90 ha in a Europe-wide network of investigated areas. Material inputs, pollutants and nutrients via air and precipitation are measured as well as their effects on the ecosystem. Their behavior within the ecosystem is determined in a comprehensive manner. With standardized methods the long-term development of the ecosystem is studied. Outputs through surface waters and into groundwater are determined. The data is used to reveal long-term trends of ecosystem functions and services which they provide as affected by air pollution and climate change.",
